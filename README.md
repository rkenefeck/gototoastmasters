#This repo is designed to hold content for the GOTO Toastmaster club.

[9:15 pm, 04/07/2025] Jordan Sands: Do we have a vision for what it would contain?
[9:20 pm, 04/07/2025] Rob: Probably a link to all the roles, the pitch, the menu booking page, the committee roles and a list of our upcoming meetings so that we dont have to share such long URL's to GDrive documents or eventbrite events. 

##Roles:
 - Meeting Roles
        Every month, the toastmaster has to send out links to the roles for every member taking a role, whether they are experienced or not. This can be a really challenging activity, having to find the Google Doc that was being used, go to the heading for the role and find the hyperlink to then copy and paste in. By having a fixed website to link to, we'll be able to have static human-readable links
- Committee Roles
        It can be hard coming into a Toastmaster committee, especially when you dont understand what the specifics of the role entail. By defining our expectations, it helps us to support each other in these roles and not be relying on 1 or 2 people to ensure everything happens. 

##Pitch:
- This is typically sent out by email, again a link to the Google Drive document. It would be far more professional if it was a link to offical website.

- Our Menu is held on a Google Sheet, but again having to share a Google sheet link (along with all the other links we send out) can be a bit much. Linking it from here (even though the content is actually the same) would be a more effective solution.

##Upcoming Events
 - Guest can register on Eventbrite for our upcoming meetings, but finding the events requires knowing the URL. This would be a placeholder to all of the upcoming
