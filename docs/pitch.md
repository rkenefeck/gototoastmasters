# GOTO Toastmasters club membership offering

### The Legend

Over the last decade, many of us have honed our skills in corporate Toastmasters clubs. The best meetings were conducted over formal dinners and in person. Rob & Leslie were having a conversation and thought, wouldn't it be nice if we could continue this entertaining and educational experience beyond an individual organisation while opening it up to a broader audience? So they set themselves a target date of May 4th.

**…On May the 4th 2024 Rob Kenefeck and Leslie Shroot achieved their goal to establish a new Toastmasters dinner club GOTO Toastmasters\!**

### What do I need to do to get involved

If you would like to commit or simply register your interest, please respond to our google form [GOTO Toastmasters Signup Form](https://forms.gle/5sJZDsEiTQ4vZudH7)

### What if I want to come along as a guest and check it out

We do require guests to pre-book ideally at least a week in advance and there is a fee to cover your meal if you attend to come as a guest please email us [goto.toastmasters.committee@gmail.com](mailto:goto.toastmasters.committee@gmail.com). We use easy-speak to manage attendance and agenda. Please also signup as a visitor on easy-speak creating an account (by clicking register) if you have never used the site [https://easy-speak.org/view\_meeting.php?c=13017\&show=next](https://easy-speak.org/view_meeting.php?c=13017&show=next) 

### How often do I get to speak and take on other roles

At formal dinner meetings we only guarantee 1 prepared speech a year, but you can deliver more speeches at a speechathon (once or twice a year depending on demand) and at our annual speech contest. We also encourage our members to deliver speeches as part of the education program outside of regular meetings such as conferences, meetups or work events (please reach out to understand how this can be achieved).

During the toastmasters contest season many clubs are looking for test speakers for evaluation contests. We can help facilitate our members being test speakers for other clubs. Being a test speaker for evaluation contests is a great way to practice speaking and get feedback from a group of experienced toastmasters.

We try to share the roles out as evenly as possible across the club which means you might only get to do a particular role once every 2 or so years (some roles we have twice in agenda to increase opportunities) , if there is a role you particularly want to do we can schedule you in. If you would like to speak more often there are many clubs in Melbourne that meet twice a month and some weekly [find a club](https://www.toastmasters.org/find-a-club). We encourage prospective members to visit multiple clubs so everyone joins a club that best meets their needs.

### How do I grow and improve if I only speak once a year?

While prepared speeches are limited, all attendees speak at every meeting, mostly through impromptu speeches (Table Topics) or when delivering auxiliary reports. These opportunities will form the bulk of your public speaking growth, delivering a micro speech every month will increase your confidence when speaking in other situations. Some of the major roles (e.g toastmaster, table topics masters) actually speak more than the prepared speakers. Evaluating and hearing other evaluations is where the bulk of your learning will come from. Identifying what other members do well and what they need to improve on allows you to grow your own techniques. 

### Can I be a member of more than one club

Yes, this club has its own membership structure which you pay separately but you can combine all the projects you complete across your clubs towards the toastmasters educational achievements, many of our members belong to more than one club.
