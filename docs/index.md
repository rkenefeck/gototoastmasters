We are a toastmasters club that meets approximately monthly in the Melbourne CBD on a Tuesday for dinner and a meeting.

### The Legend

Over the last decade, many of us have honed our skills in corporate Toastmasters clubs. The best meetings were conducted over formal dinners and in person. Rob & Leslie were having a conversation and thought, wouldn't it be nice if we could continue this entertaining and educational experience beyond an individual organisation while opening it up to a broader audience? So they set themselves a target date of May 4th.

**â€¦On May the 4th 2024 Rob Kenefeck and Leslie Shroot achieved their goal to establish a new Toastmasters dinner club GOTO Toastmasters\!**
