<h1 id="ah-counter-ah-counter"><strong>Ah-Counter</strong>  {#ah-counter}<a class="headerlink" href="#ah-counter-ah-counter" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of the Ah-Counter is to note any word or sound used as a crutch by anyone who speaks during the meeting. Words may be inappropriate interjections, such as <em>and, well, but, so</em> and <em>you know</em>. Sounds may be <em>ah, um</em> or <em>er</em>. You should also note when a speaker repeats a word or phrase such as “I, I” or “This means, this means.” These words and sounds can be annoying to listeners. The Ah-Counter role is an excellent opportunity to practise your listening skills.</p>
<p>We have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_QAhpysTXPS1eakPS3RfzaVG1E4rqbU-yLZgf75fu9M/edit?usp=sharing">Ah Counter Template</a> to help track fillers.  It’s a good idea to look at the agenda before the meeting and fill in each person’s name. This sheet prints beautifully in A4 landscape if you would like to mark it by hand instead.</p>
<p>Throughout the meeting, listen to everyone for sounds and long pauses used as fillers and not as a necessary part of sentence structure. Write down how many filler sounds or words each person used during all portions of the meeting.  </p>
<p>If someone experienced or from district leadership is speaking, pay extra attention so they get full benefit for having all their fillers counted.</p>
<p>When is a word a filler word? It’s a word that doesn’t add value to the sentence, for example starting a sentence with ‘so’ or using ‘and’ to join sentences. Repeating a word mid-sentence is also a filler. Some people have a crutch word/phrase that they tend to use, like ‘now’, ‘right’, ‘you know’ and ‘like’.</p>
<p>When you’re called on by the general evaluator during the evaluation segment, come up to the lectern to give your report. You should point out any outliers in the group, for example if one speaker did not use any filler words. You should mention the total count of filler words, if you were able to keep a count of that. If any particular filler was more predominant than any other, you can mention that.</p>
<p>After the meeting is finished, update the spreadsheet so people can see how they went individually. Feel free to post this link in the Chat room for Toastmasters to review once you have completed it.</p>
<p>Everyone means anyone in control of the room including each person in the round robin, president's introduction, toastmasters segways should be captured.</p>

<p>If you have not done the basecamp (on toastmasters.org) evaluation eLearning. It is advised that you complete this training before you do an evaluation. It explains how to fill in the evaluation form and structure and you 2-3 min oral evaluation. It takes 15-30 mins to complete.  </p>
<p>Login to toastmasters.org and select Pathways&gt;go to basecamp. Launch Basecamp. Once in base camp search for “How to Evaluate” you should find the tutorial there.</p>
<p>People join Toastmasters to improve their <strong>speaking and leadership skills</strong>, and these skills are improved with the help of evaluations. Members complete projects in the <strong><em>Competent Communication</em></strong><strong>and <em>Competent Leadership</em> manuals</strong> and you may be asked to evaluate their work. At some point, everyone is asked to participate by providing an evaluation. You will provide both <strong>verbal and written evaluations for speakers</strong> using the guide in the manual. You’ll always give a <strong>written evaluation for leadership roles</strong>, though verbal evaluations for leaders are handled differently from club to club. Sometimes verbal evaluations are given during the meeting and sometimes they are given privately, after the meeting. <strong>Check with your vice president education (VPE)</strong> or the Toastmaster if you’re not sure of your club’s method.</p>
<p>Several days before the meeting talk with the speaker or leader you’ve been assigned to evaluate and find out which manual project they will present. Review the project goals and what the speaker or leader hopes to achieve.  </p>
<p><strong>Evaluation requires careful preparation</strong> if the speaker or leader is to benefit. Study the project objectives as well as the evaluation guide in the manual. Remember, the purpose of evaluation is to <strong>help people develop their speaking or leadership skills in various situations</strong>. By actively listening, providing reinforcement for their strengths and gently offering useful advice, you motivate members to work hard and improve. When you show the way to improvement, you’ve opened the door to strengthening their ability.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the meeting, speak briefly with the general evaluator to confirm the evaluation session format. Then retrieve the manual from the speaker or leader and ask one last time if he or she has any specific goals in mind.</p>
<p>Record your impressions in the manual, along with your answers to the evaluation questions. Be as objective as possible. Remember that good evaluations may give new life to discouraged members and poor evaluations may dishearten members who tried their best. Always provide specific methods for improving and present them in a positive manner.</p>
<p>If you’re giving a verbal evaluation, stand and speak when introduced. Though you may have written lengthy responses to manual evaluation questions, don’t read the questions or your responses. Your verbal evaluation time is limited. Don’t try to cover too much in your talk; two or three points is plenty.</p>
<p>Begin and end your evaluation with a note of encouragement or praise. Commend a successful speech or leadership assignment and describe specifically how it was successful. Don’t allow the speaker or leader to remain unaware of a valuable asset such as a smile or a sense of humor. Likewise, don’t permit the speaker or leader to remain ignorant of a serious fault: if it is personal, write it but don’t mention it aloud. Give the speaker or leader deserved praise and tactful suggestions in the manner you would like to receive them.</p>
<p>After the meeting, return the manual to the speaker or leader. Add another word of encouragement and answer any questions the member may have.</p>
<p>By giving feedback, you are personally contributing to your fellow members’ improvement. Preparing and presenting evaluations is also an opportunity for you to practice your listening, critical thinking, feedback and motivation skills. And when the time comes to <em>receive</em> feedback, you’ll have a better understanding of the process.</p>

<p>Don’t worry; there’s no capital punishment during Toastmasters meetings. Unless, of course, the grammarian is in a bad mood.</p>
<p>The point of this role is to run the entire evaluation part of the meeting and Canvas guests.</p>
<p>Because we have such a long meeting and we are eating etc and want the GE to be able to concentrate on taking notes, we have invented this role just for GOTO toastmaster. Just follow the agenda and treat it like you are the toastmaster for the entirety of the evaluation section.</p>

<p>TODO: Additional Details coming. If you are taking this role reach out to the committee ASAP to get it updated. </p>
<p>Don’t worry; there’s no capital punishment during Toastmasters meetings. Unless, of course, the grammarian is in a bad mood.</p>
<p>If you think of a club meeting as a project, then you can see the general evaluator as a kind of project manager. As GE, your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the speech and leadership project evaluators know their responsibilities</li>
<li>Supervising the timer, grammarian and Ah-Counter</li>
<li>Evaluating everything that takes place during the club meeting</li>
<li>Making sure each activity is performed correctly</li>
<li>Running the evaluation part of the meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Several days before the meeting, contact the person who will be Toastmaster of the meeting and confirm the meeting program. You should also develop a checklist to follow during the meeting so you don’t have to keep all the details in your head. Some clubs have a prepared checklist. If your club doesn’t have one, ask the Toastmaster to help you create your own checklist.</p>
<p>When discussing the meeting program with the Toastmaster, ask what evaluation format to use. Typically, an evaluator is assigned to an individual, but sometimes evaluations are done by panels. The general evaluator may set up any evaluation procedure he or she chooses, but it should fit into the meeting program. Remember, too, that every evaluation must be brief and complete.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to contact members serving as: Timer, Grammarian, Ah-Counter &amp; Individual evaluators</p>
<p>Remind them of their assignments, and brief evaluators on their responsibilities, the members they will evaluate and the evaluation format to use. Make sure the evaluators understand that evaluation is a positive, helping act that enables fellow Toastmasters to develop their skills. Point out that an evaluation should enhance the speaker’s self-esteem and encourage evaluators to prepare thoroughly for their role. Recommend that they call the member they’ve been assigned to evaluate to discuss specific project objectives.</p>
<p>Your final task <em>before</em> the meeting is to prepare a brief verbal explanation detailing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose, techniques and benefits of evaluation so guests and new members will better understand the function of evaluations.</li>
<li>How evaluation is a positive experience designed to help people overcome flaws and reinforce good habits in their presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>On meeting day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrive early.</li>
<li>Make sure all evaluators are present and that they have the appropriate speaker or leader’s manual.</li>
<li>If an evaluator is absent, consult with the vice president education and arrange for a substitute.</li>
<li>Ask each evaluator if he or she has any questions about the project objectives to be evaluated, verify each speaker’s time and notify the timer if there are any changes.</li>
<li>Take your seat near the back of the room. This will ensure you have a good view of the meeting and all its participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the meeting, use your checklist and take notes on everything that happens (or doesn’t, but should). For example: Is the club’s property (e.g. trophies, banner, educational material) properly displayed? Were there unnecessary distractions that could have been avoided? Did the meeting, and each segment of it, begin and end on time?</p>
<p>Study each participant on the program, from the person giving the invocation or thought for the day to the last report by the timer. Look for good and less than desirable examples of preparation, organization, delivery, enthusiasm, observation and general performance of duties. When it’s time to begin the evaluation portion of the meeting, the Toastmaster will introduce you, again. This time, you’ll go to the lectern and introduce each evaluator. After each recitation, thank the evaluator for his or her efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, give your general evaluation of the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your checklist and the notes you took during the meeting.</li>
<li>Phrase your evaluation so it is helpful, encouraging and motivates club members to implement the suggestions.</li>
<li>You may wish to comment on the quality of evaluations. Were they positive, upbeat, helpful? Did they point the way to improvement?</li>
<li>When you’ve completed your evaluation, return control of the meeting to the Toastmaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being general evaluator is a big responsibility and it is integral to the success of every single club member. People join Toastmasters because they have a goal – they want to learn something. The club is where they learn. If the learning environment isn’t focused and fun, members won’t learn what they joined to learn. Your observations and suggestions help ensure the club is meeting the goals and needs of each member.</p>
<p>And what do <em>you</em> get out of the deal? You get the chance to practice and improve your skills in critical thinking, planning, preparation and organization, time management, motivation and team building!</p>
<p>Notes from Leslie Shroot on being General Evaluator:</p>
<p>This is the hardest role, there is quite a bit to it, so make sure you are prepared.</p>
<p>Running the Evaluation part of the meeting and Evaluating everything that has not been specifically evaluated.</p>
<p>It is really important to remember to evaluate components that have not been evaluated (i.e. speech evaluators) rather than rehashing people's speeches etc. Some meetings, there is no TT evaluator assigned, so you may need to evaluate the  TT speakers as well as TT Master.</p>
<p>Also, use the introductory parts to remind Evaluators to use 3rd person and PIPS (Praise improvement praise summary)</p>
<p>It is also recommended to reach out to all the evaluators, and Auxiliary roles, to check that people know what is expected of them prior to meeting or in the break if there is one and you have time.</p>

<p>Also, I advise you to copy the agenda into a word doc prior to meeting, and fill in your notes as you go along. If you have a multiple screen setup that is ideal (which is what I do online). You can read/write your notes, and see the audience at the same time. Alternatively, use 2 devices, one for notes, and one for meeting.</p>
<p>If you want to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>Logon to toastmasters.org and open basecamp</p>
<p>Find the specific evaluation form for each of the speakers and look at them. (share them with the evaluators if you get a chance). Read through the evaluation criteria as this will help you evaluate the evaluators.</p>

<p>## Before the Meeting
One benefit of Toastmasters is that it helps people improve their grammar and word use. Being a grammarian also provides an exercise in expanding listening skills. You have several responsibilities: to introduce new words to members, to comment on language usage during the course of the meeting, and to provide examples of eloquence.
Several days before the meeting, <strong>select a "word of the day"</strong> and update EasySpeak with that word:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a word that will help members increase their vocabulary - a word that can be incorporated easily into everyday conversation but is different from the way people usually express themselves.</li>
<li>Adjectives and adverbs are more adaptable than nouns or verbs, but feel free to select your own special word.</li>
<li>Prepare to orally give a definition of the word and an example of its usage to present in your 1 minute introduction at the beginning of the meeting</li>
<li>Make sure the word relates to the theme of the meeting</li>
<li>Put the word in easy-speak so it can be printed on the agenda</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="at-the-meeting">At the Meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#at-the-meeting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Ideally, <strong>write your word on the board</strong> when you get up to do your introduction. Also, get a blank piece of paper and pen ready to make notes. (at our venue not usually somewhere to write it but printed on a few pieces of paper around the room usually does the job - worst case it is on the agenda)<br />
When introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Announce the word of the day, state its part of speech, define it, use it in a sentence and ask that anyone speaking during any part of the meeting use it.</li>
<li>Briefly explain the role of the grammarian in one sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the meeting, listen to everyone’s word usage. Write down any awkward use or misuse of the language (incomplete sentences, sentences that change direction in midstream, incorrect grammar or malapropisms) with a note of who erred. For example, point out if someone used a singular verb with a plural subject. “One in five children wear glasses” should be “one in five children wears glasses.” Note when a pronoun is misused. “No one in the choir sings better than her” should be “No one in the choir sings better than she.”
Look for missed opportunities - if someone could have used a perfect word in a situation, but didn’t, you should include this to let them know for next time.
Write down who used the word of the day (or a derivative of it) and note those who used it correctly or incorrectly.
When called on by the general evaluator during the evaluation segment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the podium and <strong>shake the general evaluator’s hand</strong></li>
<li>Try to offer the correct usage in every instance of misuse (instead of merely announcing that something was wrong).</li>
<li>Report on creative language usage and announce who used the word of the day (or a derivative of it) correctly or incorrectly.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="table-topicstm-speaker-table-topics-speaker">TABLE TOPICS™ Speaker  {#table-topics-speaker}<a class="headerlink" href="#table-topicstm-speaker-table-topics-speaker" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Most of the talking we do every day – simple conversation – is impromptu speaking. Yet for some members, TABLE TOPICS™ is the most challenging part of a Toastmasters meeting.
Table Topics continues a long-standing Toastmasters tradition – every member speaks at a meeting. But it’s about more than just carrying on an anxiety-ridden tradition. Table Topics is about developing your ability to organize your thoughts quickly and respond to an impromptu question or topic.
Table Topics usually begins after the prepared speech presentations. The Toastmaster of the meeting will introduce the Topicsmaster who will walk to the lectern and assume control of the meeting. The Topicsmaster will give a brief description of the purpose of Table Topics and mention if the topics will carry a theme.
The Topicsmaster will state the question or topic briefly and then call on a respondent. Each speaker receives a different topic or question and participants are called on at random.
When you’re asked to respond to a topic, stand next to your chair and give your response. Your response should last one to two minutes.
Now, take a deep breath and get ready to be <em>remark</em>able!</p>
<p>![http://www.toastmasters.org/OtherImages/Speaker.aspx][image6]</p>
<h1 id="meeting-speaker-meeting-speaker">Meeting Speaker  {#meeting-speaker}<a class="headerlink" href="#meeting-speaker-meeting-speaker" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>No doubt you’ve guessed that the speaking program is the centre of every Toastmasters meeting. After all, what’s Toastmasters without the talking? But members don’t just stand up and start yakking. They use the guidelines in the <em>Competent Communication</em> (CC) manual and the <em>Advanced Communication Series</em> (ACS) manuals to fully prepare their presentations.
The CC manual speeches usually last 5-7 minutes. ACS manual project speeches are 5-7 minutes or longer depending upon the assignment.
Every speaker is a role model and club members learn from one another’s speeches. Prepare and rehearse to ensure you present the best speech possible. Don’t insult your fellow club members by delivering a poorly prepared speech. However, it’s also true that no speech is perfect. So, get out there and try! Here’s what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check your club’s meeting schedule regularly</strong> to find out when you’re assigned to speak. Begin working on the speech at least a week in advance. That way, you have enough time to devote to research, organization and rehearsal.</li>
<li><strong>If you don’t write your own speech introduction, make sure the Toastmaster of the meeting prepares a good one for you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Several days before the meeting, ask the general evaluator for your evaluator’s name.</strong> Talk with your evaluator about the speech you’ll give. Discuss your speech goals and personal concerns. Let your evaluator know where you believe your speech ability needs strengthening, so he or she can pay special attention to those aspects of your presentation. Remember to bring your manual to the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>You should arrive at the meeting early</strong> to check the microphone, lighting and anything else that could malfunction and ruin your talk. Give your manual to your evaluator before the meeting starts and discuss any last-minute issues with him or her. Sit near the front of the room and carefully plan your approach to the lectern and your speech opening.</li>
<li><strong>During the meeting, give your full attention to the speakers at the lectern.</strong> Don’t study your speech notes while someone else is talking. When you’re introduced, smoothly and confidently leave your chair and walk to the lectern. After your speech, wait for the Toastmaster to return to the lectern, then return to your seat. Listen intently during your evaluation for helpful hints that will assist in building better future talks.</li>
<li><strong>After the meeting, reclaim your manual from your evaluator.</strong> Discuss any questions you may have concerning your evaluation to clarify and avoid any misinterpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, have the vice president education (VPE) initial the Project Completion Record in the back of your manual.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll enjoy a growing sense of confidence as you repeat these steps with new speech projects. Don’t be afraid to do the work, enjoy the applause and reap the educational benefits. Your courage will be rewarded!</p>
<h1 id="timer-timer">Timer  {#timer}<a class="headerlink" href="#timer-timer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>![http://www.toastmasters.org/OtherImages/Timer.aspx][image7]</p>
<p>A timer’s job is to keep the meeting running on time and making sure people complete their speeches in the allotted time.
Here’s how to succeed as timer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green is the minimum amount of time, orange is mid way, and red is the scheduled maximum amount of time that a speaker has to finish their talk.</li>
<li>Some items just have a timing for Red - like Grammarian introduction (1 minute), speech evaluation introduction (1 minute)</li>
<li>Before the meeting, check out the agenda and see when you will need to show the green/yellow/red signals for each speaker</li>
<li>On meeting day, retrieve the timing equipment from the sergeant at arms. Use your phone timer and to do the timing.</li>
<li>Throughout the meeting, listen carefully to each program participant and signal them.</li>
<li>If someone goes more than 30 seconds over, make sure to tell them orally.</li>
<li>When giving the report, get up to the stage and shake the general evaluator’s hand. You don’t have to report everyone’s times, but only the outliers and generally how the speakers went</li>
<li>Remember to <strong>continue timing after you have given your report</strong>, for the rest of the meeting</li>
<li>Get someone else to do the timing if you are called up for a table topic or when you’re doing the timer’s report</li>
<li>After the meeting, let individuals know their exact time if they ask you</li>
<li>It’s sometimes hard to provide a new spin on timing in the Timer role, and you only have 1 minute to deliver your report. It’s worth picking up on a specific aspect of timing in the meeting (why people went over time, how long people spent on the preamble of their speeches etc) and try to provide a specific insight on the speakers of the meeting that you could only make with the help of a stopwatch.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to time table topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down each table topic speaker and time them at 1 minute for Green, 1.5 minutes for Yellow and 2 minutes for Red</li>
<li>At 2.5 minutes you can verbally let them know they have to stop talking</li>
<li>Indicate to the table topics master when there is only time for one more question - table topics always has a minimum of three speakers and should always finish on schedule. If you are running early, have more table topics speakers than usual. Around 4 minutes before the general evaluation section is due to begin, you should notify the table topics master that this will be the last table topics speaker. If there are 2 minutes or less to the general eval section, there will be no more new speakers.</li>

<p>TODO: Additional Details coming. If you are taking this role reach out to the committee ASAP to get it updated. </p>
<p><strong>You are the emcee. (GOTO toastmaster checklist is colocated with this document)</strong></p>
<p>![http://www.toastmasters.org/OtherImages/ToastmasterRole.aspx][image8]</p>
<p>The Toastmaster is a meeting’s director and host. You won’t usually be assigned this role until you are thoroughly familiar with the club and its procedures. If your club’s customs vary from those described here, ask your mentor or the club vice president education (VPE) for pointers well before the meeting.
Begin preparing for your role several days in advance. You can use the <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/tmcheck">Toastmaster's Check List</a> and/or the GOTO <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X7Z86L2b7jwmTZ2YC59FZY6sGESKVyZIoobmAFj_ceI/edit?tab=t.0">checklist</a> to help you prepare. You’ll need to know who will fill the other meeting roles and if a theme is planned for the meeting. You’ll also need an up-to-date meeting agenda. Get this information from your VPE.
Next, contact the general evaluator and make sure you’re both working from the same agenda. Ask the general evaluator to call other members of the evaluation team – speech evaluators, Topicsmaster, timer, grammarian, Ah-Counter – and remind them of their responsibilities. Remember, as the director, you’re responsible for ensuring all of the meeting’s players know their parts and hit their marks.
To help the Topicsmaster, create a list of program participants already assigned a speaking role so he or she can call on others first.
Introductions are brief and carefully planned and done by the evaluators. Contact speakers several days before the meeting to ask about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech topic and title</li>
<li>Manual and project title</li>
<li>Assignment objectives</li>
<li>Speaker’s personal objectives</li>
<li>Delivery time</li>
</ul>
<p>You need all of these elements to create your introductions. Remember to keep the introductions between 30-60 seconds in length.
For more information about introductions see <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/1167e"><em>When You’re the Introducer</em></a>(Item 1167E) and <em>The Better Speaker Series</em> module <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/277"><em>Creating an Introduction</em></a>(Item 277).
Of course, you want to avoid awkward interruptions or gaps in meeting flow so your last preparation step before the meeting is to plan remarks you can use to make smooth transitions from one portion of the program to another. You may not need them, but you should be prepared for the possibility of awkward periods of silence.
<strong>The Big Show</strong>
On meeting day, show up early. You’ll need time to make sure the stage is set for a successful meeting. To start, check with each speaker as they arrive to see if they have made any last-minute changes to their speeches – such as changing the title.
You and the speakers will need quick and easy access to the lectern. Direct the speakers to sit near the front of the room and make sure they leave a seat open for you near the front.
When it’s time to start the program, the club president calls the meeting to order. Sometimes he or she will make announcements, introduce guests or conduct other club business before introducing you.
When you’re introduced, the president will wait until you arrive at the lectern before being seated. (This is why you should sit at the front of the room.)
Pay attention to the time. You are responsible for beginning and ending the meeting on time. You may have to adjust the schedule during the meeting to accomplish this. Make sure each meeting segment adheres to the schedule. If time allows, you can make some brief remarks about Toastmasters’ educational program for the benefit of guests and new members before you move forward with the introductions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the general evaluator as you would any speaker. Remain standing near the lectern after your introduction until the speaker has assumed control of the lectern, then be seated. The general evaluator will introduce the other members of the evaluation team.</li>
<li>Introduce the Topicsmaster as you would any speaker. Remain standing near the lectern after your introduction until the speaker has assumed control of the lectern, then be seated.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some clubs it is customary for the Toastmaster and the person assuming control of the lectern to exchange a handshake. This isn’t required, but it’s sometimes done to help new members recognize when control of the lectern passes from the Toastmaster to the speaker and vice versa.
After the Table Topics session has concluded, most clubs begin the speaking program. Introduce each speaker in turn.
You will lead the applause before and after the Table Topics session, each speaker and the general evaluator. When each presenter has finished, you return to the lectern so the speaker can be seated and you can begin your next introduction.
At the conclusion of the speaking program, request the timer’s report and vote for the best speaker, if your club offers this award.
Briefly reintroduce the general evaluator. While votes are being tallied, invite comments from guests and announcements (such as verification of next week’s program).
Present trophies or ribbons as practiced by your club. Yep - Adjourn the meeting, or if appropriate, return control to the club president.</p>
<p>Serving as Toastmaster is an excellent way to practice many valuable skills as you strive to make the meeting one of the club’s best. Preparation is key to your success.</p>
<p>![http://www.toastmasters.org/OtherImages/TopicsMaster.aspx][image9]</p>
<h1 id="table-topicsmaster-table-topicsmaster">Table Topicsmaster  {#table-topicsmaster}<a class="headerlink" href="#table-topicsmaster-table-topicsmaster" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>With TABLE TOPICS™, the Topicsmaster gives members who aren’t assigned a speaking role the opportunity to speak during the meeting. The Topicsmaster challenges each member with a subject, and the speaker responds with a one- to two-minute impromptu talk.
Some people underestimate the Topicsmaster role’s importance. Not only does it provide you with an opportunity to practice planning, preparation, organization, time management and facilitation skills; your preparation and topic selection help train members to quickly organize and express their thoughts in an impromptu setting.
Preparation is the key to leading a successful Table Topics session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several days before the meeting, check with the Toastmaster to find out if a theme meeting is scheduled. If so, prepare topics reflecting that theme.</li>
<li>Confirm who the prepared speakers, evaluators and general evaluator will be so you can call on other members at the meeting to respond first. You can call on program participants (speakers last) at the end of the topics session if time allows.</li>
<li>Select subjects and questions that allow speakers to offer opinions. Don’t make the questions too long or complicated and make sure they don’t require specialized knowledge.</li>
<li>Phrase questions so the speakers clearly understand what you want them to talk about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, too, that your job is to give others a chance to speak, so keep your own comments short.
Table Topics usually begins after the prepared speech presentations, but there are variations from club to club. Ask the Toastmaster or vice president education if you’re unsure of when your portion of the meeting begins.
When the Toastmaster introduces you, walk to the lectern and assume control of the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly state the purpose of Table Topics and mention any theme.</li>
<li>If your club has a word of the day, encourage speakers to use that word in their response.</li>
<li>Be certain everyone understands the maximum time they have for their response and how the timing device works (if the timer hasn’t already done so).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then begin the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give each speaker a different topic or question and call on speakers at random.</li>
<li>Avoid going around the room in the order in which people are sitting.</li>
<li>Don’t ask two people the same thing unless you specify that each must give opposing viewpoints.</li>
<li>State the question briefly (to the entire room) – then call on a respondent.</li>
<li>You may wish to invite visitors and guests to participate after they have seen one or two members’ responses. But let visitors know they are free to decline if they feel uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Do not ask the TT evaluator to answer a question (for meetings without an assigned TT evaluator then the GE is the TT evaluator)</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch your total time. You may need to adjust the number of questions so your segment ends on time. Even if your portion started late, try to end on time to avoid the total meeting running overtime. At Servianites we finish Table topics on time as long as at least 3 questions have been asked. If the meeting is running behind time then there is less time for table topics. Prepare 8 questions as when the meeting is running to schedule there can be a lot of questions.
If your club presents a best Table Topics speaker award:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the last questions recap on who answered each question.</li>
<li><em>We don’t do this bit, but some clubs ask the timer at the end of the Table Topics session to report those eligible for the award. Though the times vary among clubs, generally a participant is disqualified for stopping 15 seconds prior to the allowed time or speaking 15 seconds beyond the allowed limit.</em></li>
<li>Ask members to vote for best Table Topics speaker and pass their votes to the sergeant at arms. Make sure you recap on who answered which question when you call for the vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have 2 table topic masters per standard meeting one during entree the other during mains. The end time for all the table topics is set so adjust the number of questions to ensure we finish on time.</p>
<h1 id="table-topics-evaluator-table-topics-evaluator">Table Topics Evaluator   {#table-topics-evaluator}<a class="headerlink" href="#table-topics-evaluator-table-topics-evaluator" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>This is a role that not all clubs do and for short meetings we tend to leave TT evaluations to the General Evaluator. There are 2 core approaches to giving the oral evaluation</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Go through each speaker 1 at a time a do a quick PIPS (praise improvement praise summary)</em></li>
<li><em>Give a overall evaluation of table topics with a large Praise, improvements across the speakers then more praise</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>It is important to remember that accuracy of content is not the important part of Table Topics. It is more important to have a properly structured mini speech (intro, body, conclusion) and to look at all the aspects for a prepared speech evaluation (eye contact, audience engagement, body language, vocal variety, clarity, gestures, comfort level)</em></p>
<p><em>Remember to exaggerate when demonstrating either a praise or improvement</em></p>
<p>We have 2 table topics evaluators and they sti next to each other in the meeting.</p>

<p>Sometimes people cannot make a meeting at the last minute due to personal or client commitments.</p>
<p>The idea is you are at least partially prepared so you can talk if you are called upon to do so. It is also a great way to increase your number of speeches for the year.</p>
<p>Put your hand up for the meeting or a few meetings before your next speech. Prepare like you are going to speak. Then if you are not called upon, use the intervening days to refine and polish your speech..</p>

<p>This is officially a committee role but we share it because no one can attend all meetings and we have an assistant because it helps with the venue.</p>

<h1 id="harkmaster-harkmaster">Harkmaster  {#harkmaster}<a class="headerlink" href="#harkmaster-harkmaster" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The main purpose of the Harkmaster role is to encourage effective listening during the meeting by compiling questions and running a quiz session towards the end.
The main responsibilities of the Harkmaster are:
To take notes during the meeting and devise questions with which to test the audience’s listening skills
To reward correct answers by handing out small rewards – usually wrapped sweets
Prior to the meeting
Prepare your introduction
Write a short introduction which stresses the importance of good listening (you might want to mention that the word “hark” means to listen) and explains the basic function of the role – i.e. that you will asking questions at the end of the meeting based on what is said during the meeting and correct answers will be rewarded with treats!
During the meeting
Take notes
Take notes on what is said by all meeting participants, starting with the President’s introduction. The aim is not to capture every detail of what is said, but to pick out information that might help you to compile questions later.
Compile your questions
Devise a number of questions based on your notes – around 6 to 8 questions is probably about right. Make sure your questions are relatively simple to explain. Include one or two easy ones to start with and some harder ones for later.</p>
<p>Here are some example questions:</p>
<p>Our first speaker, John, introduced us to the three Rs of long distance running. Who can tell me what they were?</p>
<p>In her evaluation of Tom’s speech about his recent trip to India, what was Kate’s main recommendation?</p>
<p>Based on the Timekeeper’s report, which of our table topics speakers spoke for the longest?</p>
<p>Give your report
When prompted by the Toastmaster, go to the front of the room and deliver your questions, starting with the easiest.
You can either ask the question to the room and call on someone to answer. If the person does not know the answer put it to the room. Alternatively you can use Microsoft form or other online questionnaire and get everyone to fill it in.
Keep an eye on the Timekeeper to ensure that you don’t go over time.</p>
